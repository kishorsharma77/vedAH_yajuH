## काण्व-माध्यन्दिन-भेदः
अत्र काण्व-माध्यन्दिन-शाखे वर्तेते। ३३ मन्त्राः काण्व एव सन्ति। ६६ माध्यन्दिन एव दृश्यन्ते । अन्ये समानाः, परन्तु तेष्वपि व्यवस्थाभेदः बहुत्र वर्तते। शतपथब्राह्मणे भेदाः सन्ति।

## माध्यन्दिनशाखा
> Currently found all over North India- Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and even Maharashtra (up to Nashik), West Bengal, Assam, Nepal.

## काण्वाः
> Currently found in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. In Orissa, the followers of this shakha follow a slightly different text. Epigraphic evidence shows that they were once present all over India, as far as Himachal Pradesh and possibly in Nepal.

### कलिङ्गान्ध्रपाठः
Utkala region has a lot of kAnva adhyayees only. This pATha is slightly different from that followed in TN, Mh and Kar & thus represents an ancient divergence within the kANva tradition. Some reciters also preserve exaggerated hastamudra-s like mAdhyaMdina-s & might represent a bridge between the two traditions. Perhaps, mAdhyaMdina was originally recited in manner closer to what is seen in Odisha before it lost intonations.
