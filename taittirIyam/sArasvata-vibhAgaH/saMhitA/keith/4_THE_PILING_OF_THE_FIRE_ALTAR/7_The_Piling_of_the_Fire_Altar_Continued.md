Agni I yoke with glory, with ghee,  
The bird divine mighty in strength;  
Therewith may we fly to the expanse of the ruddy one,  
Mounting the heaven above the highest vault.

These are wings unaging of thee, the winged,  
Wherewith thou dost smite away the Raksases, O Agni;  
With these may we fly to the world of good men,  
Where are the seers, the first-born, those of yore.

With our sons, our brothers, or by gold,  
Seizing the vault in the world of good action,

Whence born thou didst shine,  
Mount it, O Agni, knowing it,  
And make our wealth increase.

As guardian unfailing, do thou guard us on all sides; Let thy foes turn away again  
And be their plotting at home ruined through thy foresight.

With Indra and Agni we overthrow them;  
The Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas have made me A dread corrector and overlord, sky reaching.
