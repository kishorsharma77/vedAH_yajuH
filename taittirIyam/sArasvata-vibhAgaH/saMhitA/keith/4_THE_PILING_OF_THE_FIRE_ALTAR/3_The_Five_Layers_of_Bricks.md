In the noose of destruction may he be caught,  
Slay him with your most burning heat.

The Maruts, of the year, fair singers,  
With wide abodes, in troops among men,
  
May they from us unloosen the bonds of tribulation,  
Those that burn, delighting, granting delight,

Delight the eager gods, O thou most young,  
Knowing the seasons, O lord of the season, do thou sacrifice here; With the priests divine, O Agni,

With the means [5] of mortal men.
### t

O Maruts, accept the thousandth share of the house,  
Of the householder's offering.

Rich in oblation, bearing ghee, approacheth night and morning, To him his own devotion (approacheth) seeking wealth.

Immortal one, bear for the divine worship;  
Let them accept our fragrant (offerings).

Disport themselves like youths gazing at a spectacle, Standing in the home like beauteous younglings,  
Bestowing milk, like playful calves.

When they yoke (their teams) for their journeys, for brilliance; Playing, resounding, with flaming weapons,  
They display their own greatness, the shakers.

Like birds, O Maruts, on whatever path [7],  
The clouds spill their water on your chariots;
