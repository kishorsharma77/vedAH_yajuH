They worship rudra of beautiful teeth among the maruts,   who is [with] the sharp arrow;  
Having placed the foot of viShNu as the highest,  
by that you protect the secret of the "cows".

Hey, they who adore rudra among the maruts,  
whose pretty tooth is the sharpener!  
Having made it the place-holder of viShNu-s step,  
by that you (together) protect the secret of the "cows".

The mantra is close but not identical to a triShTubh mantra of the atri-s to agni as rudra with an association with viShNu in the maNDala 5 of the R^igveda RV 5.3.3:

> तव॑ श्रि॒ये म॒रुतो॑ **मर्जयन्त॒**+++(=मार्जयन्ति)+++  
रुद्र॒ यत् ते॒ **जनि॑म॒** +++(वैद्युतलक्षणं)+++ चारु॑ चि॒त्रम् ।  
प॒दं यद् विष्णो॑र् उप॒मं **नि॒धायि॒**  
तेन॑ **पासि॒** गुह्यं॒ नाम॒ गोना॑म् ॥

It is clear that the vaikhAnasa mantra is derived from the RV one.  At first sight, one might think the vaikhAnasa-s intended to give the RV mantra but have erroneously recorded it. However, we believe that the vaikhAnasa-s, deliberately, albeit clumsily, reworked the RV mantra to make it viShNu-centric
