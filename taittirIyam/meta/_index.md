## उपनिषद्-उपबृंहणम्
> It is possible that the there was some fluidity among the taittirIyaka schools of which upaniShad they had. The extant Apastamba/bodhAyana tarpaNa mentions sAmhitIr-; yAj~nikIr-; vAruNIr- devatA as the 3 upaniShat-s but it is not clear if bhAradvAja-s had the same. Then we have 4 upaniShat-s the 3 taittrIya valli-s and what we now call mahAnArAyaNa. But in the past it might have ended with the upaniShat after vyAhR^iti-homa-s. So was their mapping to the 3 u-s of the tarpaNa.
