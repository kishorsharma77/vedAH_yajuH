The rite of the clay li~Nga of the Kashmirian kaTha KYV v1s involves the invocation of 13 rudra-s and rudrANI-s (named below).  
This represents a rite invoking mR^ityu~njaya independently of the netra-tantra tradition.  

It raises the possibility that the tradition of netranAtha itself arose as a tantricization of an existing tradition.

The rudra-s:

1. aja ekapAd 
2. ahir budhnya 
3. kR^itivasas 
4. pinAkabhR^it 
5. vR^iShAkapi 
6. sindhu 
7. bahurUpa 
8. hara 
9. tryambaka 
10. trinetra 
11. vR^iShabhavAhana 
12. shatarudreshvara 
13. mahA-mR^ityu~njaya-bhaTTAraka

The rudrANI-s:

1. umA 
2. kAmA 
3. charvA~NgI 
4. Ta~Nka-dhArinI 
5. tArA 
6. pArvati 
7. yakShiNI 
8. shArikA 
9. shAradA 
10. mahArAj~nI 
11. jvAlA 
12. sahasra-nAmni devI 
13. bhavAnI

Of these 8-11 are the deities of local shrines in Kashmir-Panjab region  
establishing that for these kaTha-s specific locales were key part of their religious practice.+++(5)+++ 

Additionally, bhairava-s and heruka-s are invoked, but they are not primary deities. 

The use of the kaTha-shatrudrIya mantra-s in the rite  
parallels the corresponding use in the parallel rudra-pUjA of the taittirIyaka-s.  
However, several other kaTha mantra-s which may not necessarily have taittirIya equivalents are also deployed.  
However, the non-use of the li~Nga-mantra-s and the pa~nchabrahma of the taittirIyaka-s is surprising.
