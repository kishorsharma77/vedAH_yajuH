## ब्राह्मणानि
- Katha Aranyaka (almost the entire text from a solitary manuscript)
- Kathaka Upanishad, Katha-Shiksha Upanishad

## वैष्णवत्वम्
> shakha itself is seen to have a vaishnava leaning generally. Even its upanishad openly talks abt moksha sthaana being Vishnu's paramapada. The only upanishad among the old 10 which openly calls the place as paramapada. Hence, in their vaidika karmas, you will find a lot of vaishnava like influences even today - since it is the nature of that shakha.
